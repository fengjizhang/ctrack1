# Getting Started with CTrack. 

-GUI overhaul in progress-

This project is a work in progress...
CTrack visualizes the path, past and future, of objects in the sky/space on a map. 
When complete, it stores data of objects in flight, which could be anything: the international space station, meteroids, or planes. And from the past data, it should calculate the future trajectory, display their path and location on a map. Theoretically, the object should be fast moving in order to produce a calculatable path. 

The map technology used in this project is leafletjs. Its performance, lightweight, compatibility with multiple platforms and polyline rendering is advantageous in this particular use case of displaying object tracks. 

Currently Implementing a backend database using MongoDB to add more customization features to see, objects , one/multiple, show/hide future/tracks. 

Technologies used: React, Node, MySQL.
